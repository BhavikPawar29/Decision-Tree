# Decision Tree Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Decision Tree classifier from scratch, as well as an implementation using scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier. The Decision Trees are trained on the Breast Cancer dataset.

## Contents
- `DecisionTree.py`: Contains the implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm from scratch.
- `Decision Trees (with Scikitlearn).ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of Decision Trees using scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier.
- `train.py`: Script for training the Decision Tree implemented from scratch using the Breast Cancer dataset.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


Run the Jupyter notebook `Decision Trees (with Scikitlearn).ipynb` to see the implementation of Decision Trees using scikit-learn.
Run `train.py` to train the Decision Tree from scratch on the Breast Cancer dataset.
